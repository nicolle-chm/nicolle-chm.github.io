    Extralearn is an initial stage startup that offers programs on cutting-edge technologies to students and professionals to help them upskill/reskill. 
      <br> <br>
    In this MIT PE project, I sucessfully build tree-based models that can assist ExtraLearn in predicting which leads are likely to convert to paying customers. I  compared decision tree models and random forest models to get the best one. I endened up using the tuned random forest model, which boasts an 85% Recall score along with well-balanced precision and recall scores, ExtraLearn will have the capability to predict which leads will transition into paying customers. This strategic advantage will allow ExtraLearn to efficiently allocate resources while maintaining brand equity.
        <br><br>
    Furthermore, I complemented this classification model  by conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) at the outset of the analysis. I also provided conclussions and recommendations at the end to formulate effective marketing strategies based on our findings.
