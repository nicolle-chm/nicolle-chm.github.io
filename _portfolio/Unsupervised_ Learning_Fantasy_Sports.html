       OnSports is a fictitious Fantasy Sports platform that has fantasy leagues for different sports. For each player, a price is set at the start, and the price keeps changing over time based on the performance of the players in the real world. 
        <br><br> 
    In this MIT PE Project, I conducted a cluster analysis to identify players of different potentials based on previous season performance. My objective is to help Onsports understand the patterns in players' performances and fantasy returns, and decide the exact price to be set for each player for the upcoming football season.
        <br><br>
        In this unsupervised learning project, I started with an EDA. ering, and choosed the best algorithm. I employed various clustering algorithms, including K-means clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, GMM Clustering, and DBSCAN clustering.  Upon evaluating the silhouette score, I identified the optimal clustering algorithm that best captured the inherent patterns within the data. These findings culminated in a comprehensive report, replete with conclusions and actionable recommendations.
