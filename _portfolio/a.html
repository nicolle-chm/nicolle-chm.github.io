    <p>
     SuperKart is a fictional organization that owns a chain of supermarkets and food marts providing a wide range of products. They want to predict the future sales revenue of its different outlets so that they can strategize their sales operation across different tier cities and plan their inventory accordingly.
      <br>
    In this MIT PE project, a prediction model was created to predict the total sales that will be done by SuperKart in the next quarter. The model explains around 79% of the variation in the data. Furthermore, each category was carefully analyzed through Univariate and Bivariate Analysis to draw insights from them and create recommendations.
    To visuallize my findings more explicitly, I created a powert point presentation and a web page where you can put the values and it will give you the sales in the enxt quarter
