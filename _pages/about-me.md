<br>
I'm currently on an exciting academic journey as a Master's student at Alliance Manchester Business School (AMBS), where I'm actively pursuing an MSc in Business Analytics. My academic pursuits have fueled my passion for the dynamic world of technology and data.
<br>
I have a keen interest in a variety of technology-related domains, including AI, Data Science, Big Data, and Data Analytics. What truly drives me is the process of transforming raw data into actionable insights. I find immense satisfaction in working with data, uncovering hidden patterns, and crafting informative dashboards that tell compelling stories.
<br>
I've had the pleasure of delving deeply into these enthralling subjects in my academic and professional work, developing my abilities, and obtaining practical expertise in data analysis and visualisation. Whether it's employing the strength of machine learning algorithms or delving into the depths of big data, I thrive on the opportunities and challenges that technology and data present.
