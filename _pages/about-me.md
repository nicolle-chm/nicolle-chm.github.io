I'm currently a Master's student at Alliance Manchester Business School (AMBS), where I'm pursuing an MSc in Business Analytics. My academic and professional journeys have encouraged my passion for the world of finance, technology and data.

I am interested in various technology-related topics, including Fintech, AI, Data Science, Big Data, and Data Analytics. I enjoy developing forecasting models and find the challenge of combining transfer learning and machine learning models exciting.

I am strongly grounded in mathematics, statistics, and finance, with the diverse university-level modules I have undertaken in my undergraduate and master's degrees. In these, I have been developing my skills and knowledge in data science and Fintech.

At university, I serve as a consultant at 180DC, a Student Ambassador of UoM, a Student Representative of my cohort, and the Head of Events Officer for the Peruvian Society, where I lead teams, coordinate events and collaborate with university staff, corporate clients and fellow students.
