I am currently an Undergraduate Student at Imperial College London, pursuing an MEng in Molecular Bioengineering. 

I am interested in various topics relating to Technology like Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Data Analytics and Blockchain. Additionally, I am interested in how these topics can be applied to the Financial industry, as I have a personal interest with the Financial Markets. In university, I have expressed my interest in these topics through active participation in the committees for societies such as the Investment, Blockchain and Consultancy Society.
